### Mann-Whitney U test in comparing distributions of two groups

As a **product analyst**, we can use the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the distributions of two groups in order to answer a variety of research questions related to *product performance*, *customer satisfaction*, and other factors that may affect the success of your product. Here are a few examples of how the Mann-Whitney U test might be used in a product analysis context:

- Comparing the effectiveness of two different versions of a product: we can utilize Mann-Whitney U test to compare the effectiveness of two different versions of a product (e.g., an old version and a new version) to determine whether the new version is significantly more effective than the old version. We collect data on the effectiveness of the two versions of the product for a sample of users, and use the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the distributions of the effectiveness scores between the two groups.

- Comparing the satisfaction levels of customers before and after a change in product features: we can utilize Mann-Whitney U test to compare the satisfaction levels of customers before and after a change in product features (e.g., adding a new feature or removing an existing feature) to determine whether the change has had a significant impact on customer satisfaction. We can collect data on the satisfaction levels of a sample of customers before and after the change, and use the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the distributions of the satisfaction levels between the two groups. **a sample code for this use-case is added in this folder**

- Comparing the usage patterns of users in different regions: Mann-Whitney U test can be used to compare the usage patterns of users in different regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) to determine whether there are significant differences in the usage patterns between the regions. We can collect data on the usage patterns of a sample of users in each region, and use the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the distributions of the usage patterns between the regions.

The Mann-Whitney U test has some assumptions and requirements that we will need to consider when deciding whether to use it for our data. Here are some assumptions and requirements:

- Sample size: The Mann-Whitney U test is more reliable when the sample size is larger (e.g., at least 30 observations in each group). When the sample size is small, the test may be less accurate and may have less power to detect a significant difference between the groups.
- Normality: The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test, which means that it does not assume that the data is normally distributed. However, it is generally more robust to deviations from normality when the sample size is large (e.g., at least 30 observations in each group). When the sample size is small, the test may be more sensitive to deviations from normality, and may be less reliable.
- Outliers: The Mann-Whitney U test is generally resistant to the effects of outliers (extreme values that are significantly different from the rest of the data). However, if there are a large number of outliers in the data, or if the outliers are highly influential (e.g., they have a large impact on the results), the test may be less reliable.
- Non-response: The Mann-Whitney U test assumes that all observations in the sample are included in the analysis, and that there is no missing data or non-response. If there is missing data or non-response in the sample, this may affect the reliability of the test results.

*It is super important to carefully consider these assumptions and requirements when deciding whether to use the Mann-Whitney U test for any particular data. If the data does not meet these assumptions and requirements, you may want to consider using a different statistical test.*
