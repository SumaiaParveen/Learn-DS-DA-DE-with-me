### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer loyalty metric developed by Fred Reichheld, Bain & Company, and Satmetrix. It is calculated by asking customers a single question: "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company/product/service to a friend or colleague?" Customers who respond with a score of 9 or 10 are considered "promoters" and are likely to continue doing business with the company and to recommend it to others. Customers who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are considered "detractors" and are less likely to be repeat customers or to recommend the company to others. Customers who respond with a score of 7 or 8 are considered "passives" and are neither particularly positive nor negative in their feedback.

The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. So, if 50% of respondents are promoters, 30% are passives, and 20% are detractors, the NPS would be 30 (50-20). The NPS can range from -100 to 100, with higher scores indicating more positive feedback.

It's a widely used measure for customer satisfaction and loyalty, which is simple and easy to measure and can be used to compare companies, products, or services. It's commonly used by businesses to track customer loyalty over time, and to identify areas where the company can improve its performance.

- NPS = (Promoters - Detractors) / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors) x 100

- Promoters Percentage = (Promoters / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors)) x 100

- Passives Percentage = (Passives / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors)) x 100

- Detractors Percentage = (Detractors / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors)) x 100

Here's an example how we can compute NPS and utilize in business decisions. [See the solution here.]()

| Customer | Age | Gender | Product       | Score | Comment                |
|----------|-----|--------|---------------|-------|------------------------|
| John     | 25  | M      | Shampoo       | 8     | Great product          |
| Mike     | 31  | M      | Laptop        | 9     | Good performance       |
| Amy      | 35  | F      | Smartphone    | 6     | Not satisfied          |
| Jessica  | 28  | F      | Shampoo       | 7     | Nice fragrance         |
| David    | 22  | M      | Smartphone    | 8     | Could be better        |
| Julie    | 29  | F      | Shampoo       | 9     | Loved it               |
| Brian    | 32  | M      | Smartphone    | 5     | Too expensive          |
| Nancy    | 40  | F      | Laptop        | 8     | Good value for money   |
| Steve    | 38  | M      | Smartphone    | 9     | Good battery life      |
| Karen    | 27  | F      | Shampoo       | 7     | Not as expected        |

### Output

| Product       | NPS    | Promoters Percentage | Passives Percentage | Detractors Percentage |
|---------------|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Laptop        | 50.0   | 100.0                | 0.0                 | 0.0                   |
| Shampoo       | 20.0   | 40.0                 | 20.0                | 40.0                   |
| Smartphone    | -25.0  | 0.0                  | 25.0                | 75.0                   |

From the above results, we can see that the NPS for Laptops is 50, which indicates that all of the customers who responded to the survey are "promoters". This means that all of the customers who responded to the survey are likely to recommend the product to their friends and colleagues.

The NPS for Shampoo is 20, which indicates that there are more "promoters" than "detractors". This means that while some customers are likely to recommend the product, others are not.

The NPS for Smartphone is -25, which indicates that there are more "detractors" than "promoters". This means that more customers are not likely to recommend the product to their friends and colleagues than those that are likely to recommend it.

It's also worth noting that for Laptops and Shampoo, the percentages of promoters, passives and detractors correspond to the NPS value, for smartphones the percentage of detractors is 75% which is very high, indicating that majority of the customers are not satisfied with the product.

These results suggest that the company should focus on improving the customer satisfaction with their smartphones, as they have a high percentage of detractors, while Laptops and Shampoo seems to be performing well with a good NPS score. Additionally, you could also analyze other factors such as price, features, design etc to understand the root cause of the dissatisfaction with smartphones.

This way we can analyze the NPS for each product and make a comparison between the different products and identify which one is performing well and which one requires improvement. It's also possible to segment the data based on other demographic information such as age, gender, etc.
