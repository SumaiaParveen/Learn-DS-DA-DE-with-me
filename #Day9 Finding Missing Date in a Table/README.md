### How to Find a Missing Dates in a Table (T-SQL)

We need to write a SQL query that will find the missing date from a table, orders.
To solve this problem, we can use a combination of a calendar table and a LEFT JOIN. The calendar table will have all the dates between a certain range. When we left join the "orders" table with the calendar table on the "order_date" column, it will return all the dates from the calendar table that do not have a corresponding date in the "orders" table. This way we can find all the missing date in the table orders.
